## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned (random thoughts)

- Working with no figma file it's extremely hard!

- The fact that the desktop design size is bigger than my laptop's is disorienting.

- relative and absolute paths for deploying still give me a headache.
Although I feel im getting the hang of it!


### Continued development

Im still looking for an efficient way to measure gaps and padding in rems with no figma file! and no adding a root font-size
